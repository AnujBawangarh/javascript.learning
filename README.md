# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey!
This repository contains all the concepts, code examples, mini-projects, and practice exercises Iâ€™m working on while learning JavaScript â€” the language of the web.
This repo is a personal project to practice, grow, and document everything I learn about JavaScript.

ðŸ“Œ Why This Repository?
JavaScript is a core skill for web development, and this repo serves as:

A structured learning log.
A practice ground for hands-on coding.
A resource I can revisit anytime. 
A place to build mini-projects and learn by doing.
